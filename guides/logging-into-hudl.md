# Logging into Hudl
You should have received an email to setup your Hudl account as a coach. Navigate to https://www.hudl.com/login to login with your email and password. If you haven't received an email or are still having trouble with logging in, reach out to Troy at troy.edmison@hudl.com.

This is a test team just for Code Black, so feel free to play around once you're logged in.

## Schedule
A critical part of Hudl functionality is managing a team's schedule. This is what the manual testing section assignment will cover. To get to the Schedule page, hover over the `Team` menubar nav item, then click on the `Schedule` sub-nav item. Again, feel free to play around with the this feature to familiarize yourself with it.

If you want more context on the functionality of this page, checkout our [Support Article on Schedules](https://www.hudl.com/support/hudl/classic/team-management/schedule).
