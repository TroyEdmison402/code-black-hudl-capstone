# Submitting an Assignment
This guide will walk you through submitting you work from an assignment.

## Creating a File
Create a new file in the `assignment-submissions` folder. You can also copy one of the example submissions in the folder. Feel free to create a file to use locally or to use a platform you're familiar with (like Google Docs) and paste a link to your submission.

- Example of creating a [markdown test plan submission](/assignment-submissions/Example-Submission-Section-1.md)
- Example of creating a [Google doc test plan submission](/assignment-submissions/Example-Submission-Section-2.md)

## Committing and Pushing Changes
Once you've completed your an assignment, you'll want to commit and push your assignment to the cloud. Follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lSMtdeRSfGuMOLJMnOQ5Ng5Z5FnE2_JETiKvNdhMBe4/edit?usp=sharing) on doing so once you complete an assignment. You can make changes to an assignment after committing, just remember to save your file, commit and push your changes again.
